It has many strands of curly hair going down. They are smaller and thinner at the top and they get bigger as they go down. They are over his entire front. He has four legs, and at the bottom you can see some paws. He also has a tail on his back. For his body you can see texture, as if it is fur. It wraps around his body and orientates down his legs. He is standing at attention. There are additional pedestals for his legs so that he is higher. There is a plaque in the front of him. It is straight on the bottom and sides but then curves up on the top. It has upper case letters but they are not in English. Under the plaque are more designs including two inverted triangles carved into it. The lion is a gray that is weathered. The plaque is also gray. The rest of the ledge is lighter and tanned. It has some darker spots on it, so it looks like it is a little dirty. In the background, there is a lot of greenery. There are small leaves on the tree and a lot of branches. That goes from the top to the bottom of the picture. Behind the leaves there are bits of sky that can be seen. It just looks light. It is daytime because the sunlight is shining on the statue. The sunlight is a little dappled, like some of it is blocked, but it is very easy to be seen. Under the lion the stand is curved down in a diagonal way for a bit, before it continues downward. The lion also has a curved jaw that comes down in the middle for a pointier chin. The ears are curved up and have several curved in them. The nose has two nostrils that are flared up. There is an eye that is visible on one side as well. The lion seems very strong. The plaque seems to say what it is and includes the work \"LEO. \"."

The inhabitants must be worried about security because there are no glass windows or glass panes in the doors; in fact, one door has a metal grate over it for security. The most decorative building has a blue bottom and white top. Between those two colors, there is a border. The border has a bottom turquoise band of white and blue triangles. On top of the triangles is a blue band, and then another band of turquoise. The bands extend halfway up the sides of the wooden plague and door. In the middle and right areas, there are some small figures painted in blue above the top line of the border. They look like small animals."

There are two on the left and right and one wall high above the others as well as above the wooden cross. The cross is made of two beams - one vertical and one horizontal - and these beams meet in the middle about three quarters of the way up the vertical beam. There are supports on the horizontal beam as well. There is also a concrete floor that is below the seating area and in front of the cross and stone walls. The floor was poured in a circular pattern with a design in the concrete to make it appear it is stone as well. The amphitheater is surrounded by very tall trees in the background."

In the background are a couple mountains, the closest is along the right side of the photo and is covered with fields and trees and the other is a bit on the left and is too far away to tell what is on the side of the mountain."

The figure might be some celebrated war hero or commander who led a large army, given his armor, staff, and posture.

It might also be made from (bronze?), given the color it seems to have turned as a result of natural weathering over time. The sky in the background is completely clear with no clouds or anything else, just a light blue gradient. This might indicate the picture was taken early in the morning, after sunrise."

This could indicate there being some kind of nature reserve or park to the left of the boardwalk, out of frame. The picture is taken at sunset on what appears to be a summer day, with the sunrays indicating the sun is hidden by the many clouds in the sky.

The powerplant is basically the motor of the helicopter. The transmission is at the rear near the airframe and allows for the power and control of the helicopter. The main rotor system rotates the blades on top of the helicopter and the tail rotor system sits at the rear of the boom and acts similarly to a rudder to steer the helicopter. The four rotor blades, pointing to the northeast, northwest, southwest and southeast - each spins in conjunction with the other three blades to provide the aerodynamic lift force that supports the weight of the helicopter, and the thrust that counteracts aerodynamic drag in forward flight.
